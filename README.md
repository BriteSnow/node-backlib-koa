Minimalist koa utilities on top of backlib. 

- **Typed** Build with typescript for typescript.
- **Modern** Node.js 14 and above, compiled with native class fields and null coalescing native support. 
- **Minimalist** Not a framework, just some libs that can be assembled into an application infrastructure code.
- **PromiseAsync/Await centric** Use Promise/async/await patterns for all async calls. 
- **Web Async** Web request utilities based on [koajs](https://koajs.com/) over express as it is a modern rewrite of more or less the same API with backed in support for Promise/async/await (simplify many of the usecases)
